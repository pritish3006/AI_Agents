# AI Agent System Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure
1. Set up project structure and version control
2. Initialize FastAPI application with basic configuration
3. Set up Docker environment
4. Configure development and production environments
5. Implement basic authentication system

## Phase 2: Core Agent Architecture
1. Implement base agent class with common functionalities
2. Develop Coordinator Agent (central orchestrator)
   - Basic workflow management
   - Inter-agent communication system
   - State management
3. Set up initial testing framework
4. Implement basic logging system

## Phase 3: RAG Pipeline Implementation
1. Set up Pinecone integration
2. Implement document processing pipeline
3. Develop embedding generation system
4. Create caching layer for frequently accessed embeddings
5. Build basic retrieval system

## Phase 4: Specialized Agents Development
1. Implement Learning Path Agent
   - Topic analysis
   - Learning path generation
   - Progress tracking
2. Implement Content Processing Agent
   - Content summarization
   - Note generation
   - Resource recommendation
3. Implement Advisory Agent
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Learning strategy suggestions
   - Progress analysis

## Phase 5: API Layer Development
1. Design and implement REST API endpoints
2. Set up API documentation (OpenAPI)
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add API versioning
5. Enhance authentication and authorization

## Phase 6: Model Integration
1. Set up initial development with smaller model (T5-small/DistilBERT)
2. Implement model API integration system
3. Add caching layer for model responses
4. Create fallback mechanisms
5. Prepare for nemotron-4 integration

## Phase 7: Testing and Optimization
1. Implement comprehensive testing suite
2. Performance optimization
3. Load testing
4. Security testing
5. API endpoint testing

## Phase 8: Monitoring and Logging (Future)
1. Set up Prometheus integration
2. Configure ELK stack
3. Implement custom metrics
4. Set up dashboards
5. Configure alerts

## Phase 9: Production Readiness
1. Documentation completion
2. Security review
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Deployment procedures
5. Backup and recovery procedures

Notes:
- Each phase should be completed with testing before moving to the next
- Regular code reviews and documentation updates throughout
- Iterative improvements based on feedback and testing results
- Security considerations should be addressed in each phase
